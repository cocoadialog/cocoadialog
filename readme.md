## About ##

This fork from [https://github.com/cooljeanius/cocoadialog](https://github.com/cooljeanius/cocoadialog) has changes to the project so it builds against 10.9/10.10.

Most importantly it contains a fix so [cocoaDialog](http://mstratman.github.io/cocoadialog/) can display on a logouthook on 10.9+.

#### Disclaimer ####

I have no idea what I am doing, I am not a cocoa programmer. I just hacked in some changes to the method that sets the panel float level. It's probably the completely wrong approach.
